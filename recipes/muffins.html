  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Big blueberry muffins with a crusty sugar topping. This is a recipe I got from my grandma. The blueberries and the sweet batter are fabulous together — favorites of all who have tried them. They are quick and easy and made with just a few ingredients. Remember to use paper liners!</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>1 pint fresh blueberries - rinsed, drained and patted dry</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Position rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray the top of a muffin pan with nonstick spray, and line with paper liners.</li>
    <li>Cream together 1 1/4 cups sugar, butter, and salt in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time.</li>
    <li>Mix together 1 3/4 cups flour and baking powder. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk into egg mixture, mixing just until incorporated.</li>
    <li>Crush 1/4 of the blueberries, and stir into the batter. Mix the rest of the whole blueberries with the remaining 1/4 cup flour, and fold into the batter. Scoop into muffin cups. Sprinkle tops lightly with sugar.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and tops spring back when lightly tapped, about 30 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
